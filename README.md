# MCSv1
The Minecraft development license that protects your code.

The license that protects YOUR code. Unlike the MMPLv2, this
does not support open-source projects. We want to protect 
closed-source projects that don't want people to copy it, and doesn't
need to open-source the source.

# Enforcement of the License

You can make this license work, by putting a DMCA over your project and this 
has to be followed or else it will violate your user's right and you may
sue, or punishment.
